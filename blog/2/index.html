        <h3>Some State</h3>
        <p>Not a huge change tonight. We've now got some permanent state by using local storage, and a reset button, in case you're embarrased by how many times you've clicked the button.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes I've moved to JSX - I need to bite the bullet and set this up properly, think that'll be the goal for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Finally I've switched over to using the production version of React! Probably not noticeable given the size of the app.</p>
