        <h3>Let's Begin</h3>
        <p><strong>Launch!</strong></p> 
        <p>So, version <a href="/1/index.html">1.0.0 of Incremental is up</a>, it's about as minimalist as you can go, but for an evenings efforts, I'm happy. Tonight was less about Incremental and more about setting everything up. Five hours ago, I wasn't even sure what tech I was going to use, let alone have a full site with a blog set up. I decided on React in the end as it has the most support and is probably the most suitable for what will eventually be a complex application. But jeez does it feel like a retrograde step in comparison to just plain javascript or jQuery, when you're working on something simple.</p>
        <p>Since I'd never built anything with React before it was an eye-opening experience, at first, I wanted a counter separate to the button, in a different component. The problem was that working out how to share state between components was probably going to take too long for one evening in conjunction with everything else I was trying to achieve, so I cheated and put the counter into the button itself! The picture below is where I got stuck with the state, I'll get it figured out soon enough.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>I've set this up in pretty much record time on GitHub Pages; it's straightforward to set up. Since Incremental is only on the front-end, it's a good fit and being able to <i>git push</i> to update the site is an absolute joy.</p>
        <p>Critically the idea was to launch as quickly as possible and then iterate like crazy; the crazy part in conjunction with consistency should hopefully be a winning formula for building out Incremental.</p>
